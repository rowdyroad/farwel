- Updated tests for various backends and SQL data types

- Migrated from CVS to Git repository

- Changed naming convensions and style across all the source code

- Firebird backend removed from official release as not actively maintained. Available in the Git repository.

---
Version 3.0.0 differs from 2.2.0 in the following ways:

- Exposed the session's locale object.

- Moved the "no data" flag from indicators to statement.

- Allowed const objects as "use" elements.

- Added connection mode for Oracle.

- Added RAII support for transactions.

- Added the open/close/reconnect functionality.

- Added support for long long as a fundamental data type.

- Unified column names for dynamic rowset description, to overcome
  differences between database servers.

- Added the "simple" interface for interfacing from other languages.

- Added thread-safe connection pool.

- Added integrated support for Boost data types: gregorian_date,
  fusion and tuple.

- Added dynamic backend loading.

- Changed the naming convention to comply with Boost recommendations.

---
Version 2.2.0 differs from 2.1.0 in the following ways:

- Added true support for statement preparation with PostgreSQL.

- Added support for the stream-like extraction from Row.

- Added STL-compatible iterator interface for select statements.

- Refactored the set of common tests to validate core library functionality
  independently on the target database server.

- Introduced new backends for MS SQL Server (via ODBC) and Firebird.

- Provided complete build system for both Unix (autotools) and
  Windows (solution and project files for MSVC++).

---
Version 2.1.0 differs from 2.0.1 in the following ways:

- Added two additional backends: MySQL and SQLite3

- Restructured the source code layout so that the whole library was broken
  into the "core" part and independent "backends", each in its own
  directory together with appropriate tests.

- Provided basic Makefiles for static and shared libraries on
  Linux-compatible systems.

- Added the general class and function reference to the documentation.

---
Version 2.0.1 differs from 2.0.0 in the following ways:

- Corrected some typos in documentation.

- Corrected handling of dynamic rowset description for those backends
  which do not have dedicated description functionality.

- A bug fix to correctly handle std::tm in the Oracle backend.

- A bug fix to correctly handle object relational mapping when
  Values::set<T>() and Values::get<T>() are called where T is a 
  TypeConversion-based type.

---
Version 2.0.0 differs from 1.2.1 in the following ways:

- The whole library was internally re-architectured to allow operation
  with many different backends. The top-level part of the library
  (the syntax layer) provides essentially the same interface as in previous
  versions of the library, but it can work with independent (and dynamically
  selected) backends, possibly targeting different database engines.
  As a prove of concept (and to encourage developments of new backends),
  the PostgreSQL backend was provided in addition to the Oracle one.
  During this re-architecturing, some minor bugs were fixed as well.

- The old Boost-style license was changed to the new (v. 1.0) Boost license.

---
The version 1.2.1 differs from 1.2.0 in the following ways:

- A bug was fixed that caused compile errors on MS VC++ compiler.

---
The version 1.2.0 differs from 1.1.0 in the following ways:

- A memory leak when reading into Row objects was fixed.

- Bulk (array) operations were introduced for high-performance
  applications, where the number of network round-trips can be
  significantly reduced by operating on whole arrays (vectors).

---
The version 1.1.0 differs from 1.0.1 in the following ways:

- Explicit support for calling stored procedures was added.

- Dynamic row recognition (type discovery) was added.

- Support for user-defined data types was added.
